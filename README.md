## Overview
This repository, **gr8jailbreaks-gpts-**, is a collection of jailbreaks and prompt strategies designed to enhance the functionality of GPT-based AI models. The project aims to explore the boundaries of GPT models' capabilities, using prompts and jailbreaks that help unlock or extend functionality for specific use cases.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document and share various approaches to prompt engineering and jailbreak techniques that allow users to better utilize GPT models, such as ChatGPT, in creative, technical, or experimental ways. Each jailbreak comes with detailed instructions, examples, and suggested applications.

## Structure

- **Main Directory:** Contains the primary files for each jailbreak, including description, setup, and usage guides.
- **Examples:** A set of examples showcasing the use of specific jailbreaks to extend GPT behavior in practical scenarios.
- **Documentation:** In-depth documentation for understanding the mechanics behind the jailbreaks and tips for effectively modifying GPT prompts.

## Usage
To use any of the jailbreaks:

1. Browse the main directory for the jailbreak you're interested in.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the corresponding file.
3. Experiment with modifying and customizing the jailbreak for your specific needs.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions! If you have developed your own GPT jailbreaks or have found ways to improve existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure to include thorough documentation and examples with your contributions.
